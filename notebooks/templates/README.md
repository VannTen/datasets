# Template Notebooks

The purpose of those templates is to provide users with reusable notebooks that can be customized depending on the analysis period. They can be used by humans or bots to find out about stacks that failed and what inputs were used in those stacks.

The available template notebooks will allow users to analyze :
- Adviser failed runs
- Adviser most requested stacks
- Adviser successful latency

And to become more familiar with Amun inspections processes.
