# Thoth Datasets

This repo contains notebooks to download and explore the datasets provided by Thoth Team.

The datasets are available from two sources:

- On Kaggle under [Thoth Station](https://www.kaggle.com/thothstation/datasets), where you can also use them directly through Kaggle kernels.
If you want to work locally, just download the dataset after signing in with your account.

- As git LFS under this repo if you want to work on your local machine.

## Overview

The goal of this repo is to provide datasets widely available and useful for data scientists.
Thoth Team within the office of the CTO at Red Hat has collected datasets that can be made open source within the IT domain for training Machine Learning models.

## Datasets

- Thoth Solver Dataset

### Thoth Solver Dataset

Thoth Solver Dataset is based on solver reports created using [Thoth Dependency Solver](https://github.com/thoth-station/solver).

Thoth Solver Dataset is made by 10000 solver reports in json format: ~436Mb.
and it is described in the notebook called [Thoth Solver Dataset](https://github.com/thoth-station/datasets/blob/master/notebooks/thoth-solver-dataset/ThothSolverDataset.ipynb).

## How you can use the Data

You can download and use this data for free for your own purpose, all we ask is three things

- you cite Thoth Team as the source if you use the data;
- you accept that you are solely responsible for how you use the data;
