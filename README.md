# Thoth Datasets

This repo contains notebooks to download and explore the datasets provided by Thoth Team.

The datasets are available from two sources:

- On Kaggle under `Thoth Station <https://www.kaggle.com/thothstation/datasets>`__, where you can also use them directly through Kaggle kernels.

- As git LFS under this repo if you want to work on your local machine.

## Overview

The goal of this repo is to provide datasets widely available and useful for data scientists.
Thoth Team within the office of the CTO at Red Hat has collected datasets that can be made open source within the IT domain for training Machine Learning models.

## Datasets

- Solver Dataset

### Solver Dataset

Solver dataset is based on solver reports created using `Thoth Dependency Solver <https://github.com/thoth-station/solver>`__.

The Solver dataset is made by 10000 solver reports in json format: ~436Mb.
and it is described in the notebook called `Thoth Solver Dataset <https://github.com/thoth-station/datasets/blob/master/notebooks/thoth-solver-dataset/ThothSolverDataset.ipynb>`__.
